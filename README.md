# PyTorch
I have introduced the beginner concept of PyTorch AI framework.

## 🚀 What You Will Learn
- Creating tensors (1D, 2D, reshaping, transpose)
- Tensor operations (addition, matrix multiplication)
- Autograd and computational graphs
- Building neural networks with `torch.nn`
- Loss functions and optimizers
- Training loops
- PyTorch `Dataset` and `DataLoader`
- Shuffling data (RandomSampler, SequentialSampler, CustomSampler)
- Image datasets (MNIST, CIFAR-10)
- Data preprocessing and transformations
- Custom `collate_fn` for variable-length data
- Manual gradient descent

## 🛠 Requirements

You need **Python 3.8 or newer**.

### Install required libraries

Run the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision matplotlib
